xkcd-font
=========

The official xkcd font, as used on [xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com/1227/) and the April 1st, 2013 generated comic.

The original font file comes from @randallmunroe, the original font author and xkcd webcomic author. Yes, it's his handwriting. He gave us permission and hopes we [fix the pesky kerning](http://xkcd.com/1015/).

Please edit the [xkcd.sfd](xkcd.sfd) file, which can be opened with [FontForge](http://fontforge.org/), an open-source font editor. We'll periodically regenerate the OTF file from this, to avoid editing conflicts.
